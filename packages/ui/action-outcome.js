// Action outcome for the hosted console: what the operator sees when an
// action FAILS. Pure logic, browser-globals like setup-checklist.js:
// screen-l3-apps.jsx renders the result, action-outcome.test.js runs it
// under node:test. No React, no I/O.
//
// Why: on 2026-09-03 an install failed inside `cf push` and the console
// showed nothing usable - the generic error was wiped by the status refresh
// within a second, and the text Cloud Foundry printed never reached the
// result. Rule since then: every failed action produces an outcome that
// (1) names the action and the app, (2) says WHERE it failed (step, CF app),
// (3) quotes what Cloud Foundry said, (4) gives the next step in plain
// words, (5) carries a report text the operator can copy and send to Figaf.
// It stays on the page until the operator dismisses it.
//
// Input:
//   { action, appName, result, managerVersion, releaseVersion, org, space, at }
//   result = the RPC result: { ok, error, step?, cfApp?, failedApp?, command?, detail? }
// Output (failure):
//   { ok:false, title, where, error, detail, command, hint, facts:[{label,value}], report, at }
// Output (success): { ok:true, title, at }
