# Figaf-tool management through the manager — gaps before release 1

Written 2026-09-03 for the talk between Arsenii and Alex. Question to answer:
what does the hosted manager still lack to deploy, update and connect the
**Figaf tool** from the console frame, in a customer's space, as reliably as
it installs the L3 apps? Facts come from the code on branch
`poc/l3-app-manager`. Each gap ends with the decision it needs.

## 1. What exists today (facts)

- **Flows** (Alex's product, wizard frame): *Deploy Figaf Tool*, *Update Figaf
  Tool*, *Connect to Integration Suite*, *Enable persistent SSO login*, and the
  manager's self-update. The update flow is hosted-only
  (`update:*` handlers refuse desktop mode).
- **Detection** (`update:detectDeployment`): probes `<id>-app` and
  `<id>-router` with `cf app` in the **current space**; if the id is unknown,
  lists candidates through `cf curl /v3/apps` in that space. The running image
  tag comes from `/v3/apps/<guid>/droplets/current`.
- **Live configuration** (`update:readCurrentConfig`): read back from the
  deployed app's environment variables (`/v3/apps/<guid>/environment_variables`):
  `LOCATION_ID`, `MAX_RAM_PERCENTAGE`, `LOGS_TOTAL_SIZE_CAP`,
  `ENABLE_INSTANCE_MONITORING`, the SMTP cloud-connector settings, and the apps
  domain derived from `BTP_APP_ROUTER_URL`. Values that are not in the
  environment (Docker Hub user name, instance memory, the PostgreSQL plan) are
  not recoverable this way.
- **Deploy templates**: `manifest.yml`, `vars.yml`, `xs-security.json`,
  `db.json` and the approuter come from the GitHub repository
  `figaf/Figaf-BTP-Deployment`, branch `btp-users`, downloaded as a zip on
  first use per container (`resolveDeployDir`; override
  `FIGAF_DEPLOYMENT_ZIP_URL`). The update flow forces a fresh download.
- **State the manager keeps**: none that survives a restart. `vars.yml` and
  `figaf-tool-update/update-state.json` live under the session directory
  `$HOME/sessions/<sessionId>`, which is wiped on restart or restage
  (`OPEN-ITEMS.md`, "The manager has no memory").
- **Sign-in the flows assume**: the operator's own Cloud Foundry session
  (passcode) and, for role assignment and IAS, a BTP CLI login. Both are lost
  on restart.
- **Console frame** (since 2026-09-02): the Figaf-tool flows are reachable
  from the rail (`screen-figaf-tool.jsx`), but they were built for the
  one-time wizard frame and were never run end to end in the console.

## 2. Gaps

### 2.1 Never tested through the console

Fact: no run record exists for Deploy, Update or Connect through the console
frame. One known bug: the Figaf-tool login and settings are not kept when the
person leaves the flow and comes back.
Why it matters: the console is what customers will see; the wizard frame is
going away.
Decision: run Deploy and Update once in the dev space through the console and
record it like the virgin runs (figaf-l3-l4 `docs/d1/RUNBOOK-VIRGIN.md`);
then decide whether the Figaf-tool pages are **in** release 1 or **hidden**
behind a flag until they pass.

### 2.2 No persisted deployment metadata

Fact: the manager stores nothing about a Figaf-tool deployment. After a
restart it re-derives what it can from the deployed app's environment; the
rest (Docker Hub user, memory, plan, chosen tag, half-finished update) is gone.
The L3 console does not have this problem because a release version env var
on each app is the whole state.
Why it matters: "update never silently changes memory, domain, location or
SMTP" is the promise of the update flow; it needs the previous values.
Options: (a) write a metadata entry per deployment into the Credential Store
(the manager already owns a namespace there); (b) put the missing values into
the deployed app's own environment or CF metadata labels at deploy time, so
they can be read back like the others; (c) keep the current best-effort
re-derivation and ask the person for the rest.
Decision: pick (a) or (b); (b) keeps the runtime independent of the manager,
which is the rule for the L3 apps too.

### 2.3 Which identity runs Figaf-tool operations

Fact: the L3 console signs in as the stored technical user after Setup step 1.
Alex's flows expect the person's own CF session and optionally a BTP login.
Cross-space discovery under the technical user needs at least Space Auditor
in the Figaf-tool spaces (`OPEN-ITEMS.md` item 5); the BTP login does not
survive a restart, so `btp assign` steps fail after one.
Decision: is the technical user also allowed to deploy and update the Figaf
tool? If yes: its roles per space become part of the customer prerequisites
(figaf-l3-l4 `docs/d1/MANUAL-RUNBOOK.md`, top section). If no: the console
must ask for a passcode before these flows and say why.

### 2.4 Templates are unversioned and fetched from GitHub at run time

Fact: the templates are the HEAD of a GitHub branch, downloaded by the
customer's container. The manager's own zip is versioned; the templates it
applies are not. Self-update also calls `api.github.com`; tag lookup calls
Docker Hub.
Why it matters: "one build, one version, one delivery" (governance decision
2). An update can pick up template changes nobody released. Customers with
restricted egress cannot reach GitHub; `FIGAF_DEPLOYMENT_ZIP_URL` and
`FIGAF_DISABLE_SELF_UPDATE` are the only knobs today.
Decision: ship the templates versioned inside the manager release (the same
shape as the L3 release catalog), or version them in the source repository
by tag and pin the tag in the manager. Either way the Docker Hub and GitHub
calls need a documented offline story.

### 2.5 Connect to Integration Suite is partly a stub

Fact: the custom SAML IdP path is complete; the IAS, S-user and passport
modes are stubs (`screen-connect-idp-{ias,suser,passport}.jsx`). PI/PO
connectivity services are reserved but commented out in the template.
Decision: which modes does release 1 support? Hide the stubs.

### 2.6 Legacy installations and the shared XSUAA instance

Fact: existing Figaf Manager installations are bound to `figaf-manager-xsuaa`
(legacy mode, decision 0009). New installations use `figaf-l3l4-xsuaa`. The
approuter accepts both scopes; no migration exists.
Decision: when and how legacy installations move (rebind, restage, reassign
the collection), and whether Alex or the L3 stream owns it.

### 2.7 Manual

Fact: the published manual describes the wizard frame screen by screen. The
console frame changes navigation, sign-in order and the Setup page.
Decision: one manual for the console (Figaf tool and L3 apps), or two.

## 3. Gaps on the Figaf tool side (L2 API)

Recorded in figaf-l3-l4 `docs/SOLUTION.md` 5.1: there is no published
`/api/v1` endpoint to create or list API clients, and none that reports a
client's scopes. Until they exist, connecting the manager to a Figaf tool
means typing a client id and secret created by hand in the Figaf tool's admin
UI. Backlog items for the Figaf tool, not workarounds.

## 4. Proposed order

1. Test run of Deploy and Update through the console in the dev space; record it.
2. Decide 2.3 (identity) and 2.2 (metadata) together; they shape the prerequisites.
3. Decide 2.1: in or hidden for release 1.
4. Version the templates (2.4).
5. Manual (2.7) after the console pages are final.
